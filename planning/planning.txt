## Operational Questions

- Would we like people to be able to search listings without an account?
- What fields would we like in a user account? Country?  (Street address isnâ€™t necessary and would help remove privacy concerns)
- Should we have the area of a listing auto populate to their area, but allow the user to change it if they choose?
- Should bidding be an optional thing, or should we allow posters to set a fixed price?
- Should we conceal the names of bidders until a bid is accepted?
- Should we have a default image for ads in which a user does not add one to maintain consistency in design?
- Should we have some kind of badges feature as a stretch development. People could earn badges for jobs completed when they are ranked good and display them when they bid to show they are a trusted worker.
- Sort by fields: date newest, oldest, suggested bid lowest, highest
- Do we want bidders to see existing bids or are those private to the owner of the job?
